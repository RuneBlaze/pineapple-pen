Act as a "mechanical DM" for a turn-based JRPG. This JRPG is a turn-based tactical game,
where there is a small "board" of the battlefield, and each battler can move around the board.
You will return to me the code that simulates a turn in the game, based on an action
that one of the battlers takes. After the code is executed, the game state should be updated,
and I will query you for the updated board. In other words, you are supposed to

1. Write some Python code that simulates a turn in a JRPG game.
2. Then I will execute the code for you, and given the logs and the outcomes, you will tell me
   the updated battlefield state.
